# KPMG Virtual Internship

Organisations need to better leverage data resources to create value, enhance competitiveness and drive business decisions. They need to harness the vast volumes of data available – historic, current and predictive – so they can extract what they need and make new discoveries.
This internship focuses on Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation.

The internship consisted of three stages:
1. Data Quality Assessment - preliminary data exploration and identification of ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data.

2. Data Insights - using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, recommend which of the 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation. Prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off. 

3. Data insights and Presentation - develop a Power BI dashboard to visualise insights for the client
